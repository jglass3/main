      "Similarly, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories of the USDA have reported COVID-19 in tigers and lions that exhibited respiratory signs like dry cough and wheezing. The zoo animals are suspected to have been infected by an asymptomatic zookeeper (335). The total number of COVID-19- positive cases in human beings is increasing at a high rate, thereby creating ideal conditions for viral spillover to other species, such as pigs. The evidence obtained from SARS-CoV suggests that pigs can get infected with SARS-CoV-2 (336). However, experimental inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 failed to infect pigs (329).  Further studies are required to identify the possible animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and the seasonal variation in the circulation of these viruses in the animal population. Research collaboration between human and animal health sectors is becoming a necessity to evaluate and identify the possible risk factors of transmission between animals and humans. Such cooperation will help to devise efficient strategies for the management of emerging zoonotic diseases (12). \n",
