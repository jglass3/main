Using Github as my personal portfolio to document numerous scripts that I have made or scripts that I have found and modified.
Script may be in either in Python, VBA, JavaScript (Google App or Excel Online), and SQL when applicable.

**Adding Data Science projects 

Docs beginning with JS are my JavaScript (Google App Script) that I have personally developed over time.

Docs beginning with JSEx are my JavaScript Excel Online based that I modified for production use. 

Docs beginning with VBA are my maros written for my excel projects/files

Docs beginning with Py and SQL are my templates that I created walking through tutorials online.
  Note: Python projects are found in my Juypter Notebook
